A couple of programs written to learn PyQT.

fwdb - Was a GUI interface for a small database of firewalls I kept for my own use. The database contained confidential information on CHS firewall so I didn't keep the database when I left.

qsqlmapper - Interface to a small database that demonstrated how to open one display one value in a drop down list (i.e. book_name) but enter the index value in an orders table. Unfortunately I'm dumb and forgot to keep the database.

I keep these around as refreshers in QT if needed.
